## What is Blue Arcade?
Blue Arcade is a plugin that deals with the classic Party Games game that offers a wide variety of mini-games. The objective is to get the highest score by winning as many mini-games as possible, with the ultimate goal of securing first place.

In addition, if you prefer, you can also set up arenas with a single round of a specific mini-game. For example, if you need a server for the "TNT Tag" mini-game (or any other available mini-game), this plugin can help you.

## Features
- Multi arena support. You can create as many arenas as you want.
- Compatible with 1.17+
- Easy to setup through a configuration wizard.
- Highly customizable. You can customize all messages and sounds of the plugin.
- PlaceholderAPI support.
- Current mini-games included in BlueArcade (12): Race, Spleef, Snowball Fight, All Against All, One In The Chamber, Traffic Light, Minefield, Exploding Sheep, TNT Tag, Red Alert, Knock Back

### Planned Features
- Vote to choose mini-games before starting an arena.
- Leaderboards with players statistics.
- Party system with menu.
- Bungee mode.
- MySQL support.
